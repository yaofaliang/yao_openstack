        inherited). If include_subtree is True, then assignments on all
        descendants of the project specified by project_id are also included.
        The inherited filter defaults to None, meaning to get both
        non-inherited and inherited role assignments.

        If effective mode is specified, this means that rather than simply
        return the assignments that match the filters, any group or
        inheritance assignments will be expanded. Group assignments will
        become assignments for all the users in that group, and inherited
        assignments will be shown on the projects below the assignment point.
        Think of effective mode as being the list of assignments that actually
        affect a user, for example the roles that would be placed in a token.

        If include_names is set to true the entities' names are returned
        in addition to their id's.

        source_from_group_ids is a list of group IDs and, if specified, then
        only those assignments that are derived from membership of these groups
        are considered, and any such assignments will not be expanded into
        their user membership assignments. This is different to a group filter
        of the resulting list, instead being a restriction on which assignments
        should be considered before expansion of inheritance. This option is
        only used internally (i.e. it is not exposed at the API level) and is
        only supported in effective mode (since in regular mode there is no
        difference between this and a group filter, other than it is a list of
        groups).

        In effective mode, any domain specific roles are usually stripped from
        the returned assignments (since such roles are not placed in tokens).
        This stripping can be disabled by specifying strip_domain_roles=False,
        which is useful for internal calls like trusts which need to examine
        the full set of roles.
